## Introduction 
As a group we decided to build a trail app called Trail Blazer that helps users
navigate, track and explore the outdoors. The user's activity can be recorded and
saved privately or shared with friends.

## Description 
This is your guide to Albuquerque's outdoors. Discover, share and blaze your 
favorite trails right from your phone. 

## Intended Users
Any Burqueno that loves to enjoy New Mexico's beautiful weather and perfect hiking trails!
