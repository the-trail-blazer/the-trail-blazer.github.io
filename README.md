## Description 
As a group we decided to build a trail app called Trail Blazer that helps users
navigate, track and explore the outdoors. The user's activity can be recorded and
saved privately or shared. This is your guide to Albuquerque's vast open trails. 
Discover, share and blaze your favorite trails right from your phone. 

## Intended Users
* Any Burqueno that loves to enjoy New Mexico's beautiful weather and perfect hiking trails! 
* Visitors who want to explore Albuquerque. 
* Friends who want to share their trails. 
* Outdoor enthusiasts looking for new adventure!
